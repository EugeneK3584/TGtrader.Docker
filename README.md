# TGtrader_docker
TGtrader server for external webhooks in docker for Bybit


Hi all, I'm looking for bug testers for my ByBit bot, you can connect it to LC or any other webhooks alerts  sources , I was focusing specifically on trade management for handling  more than 10 positions at once and etc . 1. Actual order entry from webhook source in Testnet https://youtu.be/vQ3hkkFoEwA  . 2. Order management demo in live acc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCOpB7cqE-0 .  , This was initially designed for other sources , but will be more that enough for LC or similar indicators
